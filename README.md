# 🧠 Sentiment Analysis Using Machine Learning

This is a simple Sentiment Analysis project built using **Python**, **Scikit-learn**, and basic **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques.

The goal is to classify input text (e.g., reviews, comments) as **positive** or **negative** using traditional machine learning algorithms.

## 🚀 Features
- Preprocesses raw text using tokenization, stopword removal, and TF-IDF vectorization
- Trains a machine learning model (e.g., Logistic Regression or Naive Bayes) for classification
- Evaluates the model using accuracy and confusion matrix
- Predicts sentiment on new/unseen text inputs

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas & NumPy
- Natural Language Toolkit (nltk)
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

## 📊 Sample Workflow
1. Load and clean text dataset
2. Convert text to numerical features using TF-IDF
3. Train a classifier on the training data
4. Evaluate model performance on the test set
5. Make predictions on new inputs

## 📁 Dataset
A sample dataset of labeled text data (positive and negative) is used. You can replace it with your own custom dataset for experimentation.

## 📝 How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Open the notebook in Jupyter or Google Colab
3. Run each cell step-by-step
4. Modify or improve the model for better accuracy!

## ✅ Future Improvements
- Add deep learning model (e.g., LSTM)
- Use pre-trained models like BERT
- Expand to multi-class sentiment (e.g., neutral, mixed)
